Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
Note: You are not suppose to use the libraryâ€™s sort function for this problem.
Can you do this in a single pass?
Example:
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Here's a starting point:
"""

class Solution:
  def sortColors(self, nums):
    # Fill this in.
    """
    #Here is my code, straightforward but not the most efficient
    num0 = nums.count(0)
    num1 = nums.count(1)
    num2 = nums.count(2)
    nums.clear()
    
    for i in range(num0):
        nums.append(0)
    for i in range(num1):
        nums.append(1)
    for i in range(num2):
        nums.append(2)
